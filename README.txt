1. Run the data analyzing part of the code
2. Output part of the data and visually select some which is useful for training(R3 R4)
3. Use R3(1:120,:) and R4(1:120) for training
4. Labeling the data (get label, whitening training data and the whitening matrix)
5. Use the featureSelection and decide how many features are needed
6. Use getNewFea to get the new features set from feature selection
7. Use dataBalance the balance the data (because usually class1 is more donimated)
8. As for the testing dataset, they have to pass through the same whitening matrix
